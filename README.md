IITBBS Batch 2022 Sem-II Time Table

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Time Table website! This website is designed to provide a simplified and easy-to-understand time table for first-year B-Tech students at IIT BBS. The website includes a dynamic feature where you can enter your roll number, and it will display the time table for the current day or the next day based on the time.

|| Introduction ||

The time table provided to us as first-year B-Tech students  can often be confusing and time-consuming to navigate. To address this issue, we have created a simple and user-friendly website that presents the time table in a clear and organized manner. The website also includes a convenient feature that automatically displays the time table for the current day or the next day based on the time.

|| Features ||

Simplified Time Table: Our website provides an easy-to-understand time table . The time table is presented in a structured format, allowing you to quickly locate your classes and their respective timings.

|| Dynamic Time Table ||

By entering your roll number, the website automatically determines the current day and time. If it is before 17:00 (5:00 PM), the website displays the time table for the current day. However, if it is after 17:00, the website shows the time table for the next day, taking into account your tutorial group and lab group.

|| Usage ||

To use the dynamic time table feature, follow these steps: Visit the website:https://iitbbs-2022-batch-sem-ii-time-table.netlify.app/ On the homepage, you will find an input field labeled "Enter Your Roll Number." Enter your roll number in the input field and press the "Submit" button. The website will determine the current day and time. If it is before 17:00 (5:00 PM), the website will display the time table for the current day. If it is after 17:00, the website will show the time table for the next day, considering your tutorial group and lab group. You can easily navigate through the time table to find your classes and their respective timings. Feel free to explore other features of the website, such as UI improvements and general usability.
